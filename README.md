# AttachmentDumper
Windows Service that downloads attachments of one or more email inboxes to a folder

Configure the mailboxes using the config.cfg in the release zip-file and store it next to the binaries. You need to restart the service if you change this config.
To install the service, execute the "Install Service.bat" as administrator. A new Windows Service will be created.
